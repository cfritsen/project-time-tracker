# project-time-tracker
A timer which can be used to track time spent on projects. Built in React

<h3>What is it / How to use</h3>
The Project Time Tracker is a module skeleton built for a future project. In its current form, it is 100% front-end, meaning all of the time entries will disappear when you refresh the page.
In the future when it's implemented into the planned project, timecards will be saved to individual projects.

When you press Start, the timer starts. When you press Stop, the timer ends and records a time entry to the right. Press Start again and the timer resets and restarts, but the time entries remain until refresh.

Fork the project, then in a terminal at the folder, use 'npm install' to install dependencies, then 'npm run start'.
